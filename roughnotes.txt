		country4
		goalguess
		playerstotalpoints (adding all of each country totalpoints)

i manually enter every player entry
i also manually input scores/goals into the country table as the games happen
as i add each result, this will update each players "playerstotalpoints"

every time page is opened there is a calc run:
	for each player in the standings table,
	get their name, 4 countries, goalguess and 
	(then calc the points total from their 4 countries from the data on the country table,
	this calc is not persisted and only used in that instant,
	so get country1 country_id to get that country's "countrystotalpoints",
	repeat for the other 3 and sum the 4 values)
	OR
	(do the calc on backend and have the value persisted as playerstotalpoints which is just requested on page load)
