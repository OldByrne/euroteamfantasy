Euro 2024 fantasy competition. Rules explained in readme.

Layout:
You pick one team from each of the 4 pots in the pic I will put up below these will be your teams for the full competition so if they all go out at group stages youâ€™re unlikely to win ðŸ˜‚. You will be given points for your teams as follows:

Draw = 1 point
Win = 3 points 
Goals scored for team in pot 1 & 2 = 5 points per goal
Goals scored for team in pot 3 & 4 = 8 points per goal
Goals conceded for team in pot 1 & 2 = -3 points per goal
Goals conceded for team in pots 3 & 4 = -2 points per goal 
You also need to say how many goals you think there will be in the competition and in the event that there are people on the same number of points at the end of the competition it will be used as a tie break (whoever is closest to the number).
